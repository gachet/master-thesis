### Infrastructure deployment
Infrastructure deployment has been a large part of the project. As part of it, the following guidelines have been generated:
1. [Enviroment description](./environment-description.md). 
2. [Setting up an HDFS cluster](./hadoop-cluster-setup.md).
3. [Setting up and running a Standalone Spark cluster](./spark-standalone-cluster-setup.md).
4. [Running Jupyter notebooks on Spark Standalone clusters](./jupyter-setup.md).
5. [Running Zeppelin notebooks on Spark Standalone clusters](./zeppelin-setup.md).
6. [Saving data from Spark to Elasticsearch indices](./spark-elasticsearch-setup.md)
7. [Setting up Kafka](./kafka-setup.md)

All the configuration files can be found in a the [conf folder](../conf/).

# Setting up an HDFS cluster
HDFS is the primary distributed storage used by Hadoop applications. An HDFS cluster consists of a *NameNode* that manages the file system metadata and *DataNodes* that store the actual data

This tutorial is based on [the official Hadoop documentation](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html) and [other resources found on the Internet](https://chawlasumit.wordpress.com/2015/03/09/install-a-multi-node-hadoop-cluster-on-ubuntu-14-04/). It is important to note that as new releases come out, some properties become deprecated and old tutorials are no longer entirely valid (see the [list of deprecated properties](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/DeprecatedProperties.html)).

This tutorial assumes that [several instances have been created on an Openstack cloud](doc/environment-description.md). No specific dependencies to this type of cloud (beyond the handling of private/public -floating- IP addresses) have been detected so that the procedures should provide relevant information for setting up a cluster in many environments.

### Components of the cluster
The HDFS cluster is made of four nodes: one master (`cluster-master`) and three slaves (`cluster-slave-1`, `cluster-slave-2` and `cluster-slave-3`). Slaves will run a *DataNode* each, while only a *NameNode* will run on the master node (initial configurations deployed also a *DataNode* on the master node, but this configuration did not work as the *NameNode* run out of resources frequently; see [key take-aways](#key-take-aways) below).

### Java installation on all instances
Java must be installed in all the cluster instances: ***Oracle Java 8*** has been chosen (some tutorials found on the Internet, such as [this](http://tecadmin.net/install-oracle-java-8-jdk-8-ubuntu-via-ppa/) and [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19275856/auto-yes-to-the-license-agreement-on-sudo-apt-get-y-install-oracle-java7-instal)) are used):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
echo oracle-java8-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 select true | sudo debconf-set-selections
echo oracle-java8-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 seen true | sudo debconf-set-selections
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y oracle-java8-installer
sudo apt-get install -y oracle-java8-set-default
```

Verification of a successful Java installacion can be done by typing `java -version` in the console. The output must be similar to this:
```bash
java version "1.8.0_144"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_144-b01)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)
```

### Hadoop installation on all the instances
Hadoop is needed to create an HDFS cluster: [Hadoop 2.7.4](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.4/) will be used.
```bash
wget http://ftp.cixug.es/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.4/hadoop-2.7.4.tar.gz
tar -xvzf hadoop-2.7.4.tar.gz
sudo mv hadoop-2.7.4 /usr/local/hadoop
rm hadoop-2.7.4.tar.gz
```

### Hadoop environment variables setup on master and slave nodes
In order to determine the actual Java home, the following command can be used:
```bash
readlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed "s:bin/java::"
```

Next, the following environment variables are set in the `.bashrc` file under `/home/ubuntu` (both on master and slave nodes):
```bash
echo '
# Set HADOOP_HOME
export HADOOP_HOME=/usr/local/hadoop
# Set $HADOOP_CONF_DIR
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop
# Set $HADOOP_LOG_DIR
export HADOOP_LOG_DIR=$HADOOP_HOME/logs
# Set JAVA_HOME 
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre
# Add Hadoop bin and sbin directory to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/sbin
' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Once updated, the `.bashrc` file must be reloaded:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, the `$JAVA_HOME` variable has to be updated in the `hadoop_env.sh` configuration file on master and slave nodes:

```bash
sed -i 's/export JAVA_HOME=${JAVA_HOME}/#export JAVA_HOME=${JAVA_HOME}\nexport JAVA_HOME=$(readlink -f \/usr\/bin\/java | sed "s:bin\/java::")/' $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hadoop-env.sh
```

### ssh installation on all instances
Ssh is required to enable password-less communication between master and the slave instances in the cluster.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ssh -y
```

### /etc/hosts update in all instances
Here it is important to note that ***private IP addresses*** must be used in this file (no floating IP addresses are involved here).

```bash
echo "
<master-ip-address>		cluster-master
<slave-1-ip-address>	cluster-slave-1
<slave-2-ip-address>	cluster-slave-2
<slave-3-ip-address>	cluster-slave-3
" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts
```

### Password-less ssh setup
As mentioned above, password-less ssh communication between the master and the slaves is required to set up the HDFS and Spark clusters. It can be achieved by means of different approaches. It is important to note that the access to the instances in any Openstack cluster is already ssh-based and password-less. In the target environment, there is a cloud private key employed to deploy the Openstack instances (named `lab`). That is, any instance in the target Openstack cloud already accepts ssh connections from clients that use the `lab` private key. From a technical point of view, it means that any instance have a `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys` file containing the `lab` public key.

#### Option 1: password-less authentication by means of the Openstack cloud key
A simple approach can take advantage of the Openstack communication schema. That is, making the private key available on the master node would be enough (if unsure about security, mind that any user able to connect to an instance in the Openstack cloud already has the cloud private key). The `lab` private key (with OpenSSH format) is copied to the `/home/ubuntu/.ssh` folder on the master node (using any secure FTP client). As [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) is being used to handle connections, a private key with proper OpenSSH format would be obtained from the `lab.ppk` file (PPK is the format used by PyTTY for private keys). The transformation can be carried out by means of PuTTYgen, by loading `lab.ppk` and exporting it as an OpenSSH private key. The resulting private key will be named `id_rsa` and subsequently uploaded to the master instance and copied to the `/home/ubuntu/.ssh` folder.

Once in the proper folder, the key file must be given the right permissions as well:
```bash
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Finally, the password-less connection can be tested by using the following command in the master instance (`StrictHostKeyChecking=no` can be used to avoid an interactive dialogue in the first connection):
```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cluster-slave-1
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cluster-slave-2
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cluster-slave-3
```

A connection to each of the slaves will be obtained without needing a password.

#### Option 2: creation of a new key pair and distribution from the master instance
Leaving permanently the private Openstack cloud authentication key in the master instance is likely not feasible from a security point of view. Thus, an alternative schema can be suggested: the cloud private key is used only to upload a private key (from a new key pair) to the slave instances. Once uploaded, the cloud private key is removed from the master instance.

The procedure is as follows: first, the `lab` private key is uploaded to the master instance as described previously and proper permissions are set. As a result, the private Openstack cloud key becomes available at the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` folder in the master instance. Next, a new pair of keys is generated on the master instance (mind the new key names in order not to overwrite the existing private key).
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/idhdfs_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/idhdfs_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Once created, the new public key in the pair (`idhdfs_rsa.pub`) is uploaded from the master instance to the slaves by means of the command `ssh-copy-id`:
```bash
for x in cluster-slave-1 cluster-slave-2 cluster-slave-3; do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/idhdfs_rsa.pub $x; done
```
As a result, the public key becomes available in each slave instance within the `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. Finally, the `lab` private key file (`id_rsa`) is deleted on the master instance, and the newly-created pair of keys is renamed so that the default key file names are used:
```bash
rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa
mv ~/.ssh/idhdfs_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa
mv ~/.ssh/idhdfs_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
From that point on, this new key pair is the one that will be used in the communications between the master and the slave instances:

Verify that seamless ssh connection is enabled by running the following commands on the master instance:
```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cluster-slave-1
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cluster-slave-2
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cluster-slave-3
```

#### Option 3: creation of a new key pair and distribution from a different instance
It is possible not to expose at all the Openstack cloud private key. A new pair of keys and a proper `authorized_keys` file are created out-of-the-box (for instance, in another instance of the cloud) and distributed to the members of the cluster.

First, access an instance in the cloud, create a new pair of keys, and the `authorized_keys` file (not overwriting any existing file):
```bash
cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ~/.ssh/authorized_keys_original
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
As a result, there will be three files in the `~/.ssh/` folder: `id_rsa`, `id_rsa.pub` and `authorized_keys` (besides the old `authorized_keys`, now `authorized_keys_original`). `id_rsa.pub` can be removed, as it is no longer necessary. Retrieve the two remaining files (afterwards you can restore the old `~/.ssh/authorized_keys_original`), upload them to the master instance and move them to the `~/.ssh/` folder (replace the file ` ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with the one it has been uploaded). Set the proper permissions:
```bash
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Upload `authorized_keys` to the slave instances and move it to the `~/.ssh/` folder, replacing the already existing in there. Set the proper permissions:
```bash
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Verify that seamless ssh connection is enabled by running the following commands on the master instance:
```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cluster-slave-1
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cluster-slave-2
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cluster-slave-3
```

### HDFS instance configuration
Three configuration files have to be updated on master and slave instances in order to have the HDFS cluster configured: `core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml`, and `slaves` (mind that some variables become deprecated as new versions of Hadoop come out, be aware of that). They are available in the directory `$HADOOP_CONF_DIR`. Although there are some options that are only relevant for the master, it is simpler to copy the same configuration files to all the instances in the cluster.

#### `core-site.xml`
First, `core-site.xml` must be updated on all instances (master and slaves), in order to set the properties `hadoop.tmp.dir` and `fs.defaultFS`:
```bash
echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="configuration.xsl"?>

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hadoop.tmp.dir</name>
    <value>file:///usr/local/hadoop/tmp</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
     <value>hdfs://cluster-master:9000</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
' > $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/core-site.xml
```

#### `hdfs-site.xml`
`hdfs-site.xml` must be updated on master and slave nodes in order to activate the properties `dfs.replication`, `dfs.namenode.name.dir`, and `dfs.datanode.name.dir`. Default values can be found [here](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/hdfs-default.xml):
```bash
echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="configuration.xsl"?>
<configuration>
  <property>
  <name>dfs.replication</name>
    <value>3</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
    <value>file:///home/ubuntu/hdfs/namenode</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
    <value>file:///home/ubuntu/hdfs/datanode</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
' > $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hdfs-site.xml
```

Some remarks about the variables:
* `dfs.replication`: it specifies the default block replication. That is, it defines how many machines a single file should be replicated to before it becomes available. If its value is set to a value higher than the number of available slaves (actually *DataNodes*), there will errors. The default value is 3. As three slaves are available, `dfs.replication` is set to 3.
* `dfs.namenode.name.dir`: Directory is used by the *NameNode* to store its metadata file. Thus, manual creation of the directory on all nodes is required.
* `dfs.datanode.name.dir`: Directory is used by *DataNodes* to store its metadata file. Thus, manual creation of the directory om all nodes is required.

```bash
rm -r /home/ubuntu/hdfs/namenode
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/hdfs/namenode
rm -r /home/ubuntu/hdfs/datanode
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/hdfs/datanode
```

#### `slaves`
Finally, the `slaves` file is updated, only on the master node:
```bash
echo "cluster-slave-1
cluster-slave-2
cluster-slave-3
" >> $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/slaves
```

### HDFS filesystem format via the *NameNode*
It can be done by means of the HDFS CLI (mind that if the filesystem is formatted again in some time in the future, there will be errors related to inconsistent clusterID; *DataNodes* on slave instances will keep the reference to the old *NameNode* and thus deletion and recreation of data folders will be needed):
```bash
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs namenode -format
```

### Distributed File System start and stop
Although it is possible to start HDFS and YARN daemons at once, it is better to run them separately, obviously if YARN is not needed. The scripts for starting and stopping the HDFS and YARN daemons are available in the `$HADOOP_HOME/sbin` folder. HDSF daemons are started by running, only on the master node, the following script:
```bash
$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/start-dfs.sh
```

To validate it has started successfully, the JVM Process Status tool (`jps` command) can be run on the master and slave instances. The output should list `NameNode` and `SecondaryNameNode` on the master node:
```bash
16947 NameNode
17324 SecondaryNameNode
17470 Jps
```

And a `DataNode` in each slave instance.

If this output is not got on all the instances of the cluster, it is necessary to analyze the log files available at `HADOOP_LOG_DIR`. Relevant log files are `hadoop-ubuntu-datanode-cluster-master.log`, `hadoop-ubuntu-namenode-cluster-master.log`, and `hadoop-ubuntu-secondarynamenode-cluster-master.log`.

The status of the HDFS cluster can be verified in the [HDFS Web Interface](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.4/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html#Web_Interface) at `http://<master-floating-ip-address>:50070/`:

![HDFS Web Interface at http://<master-floating-ip-address>:50070/](./images/HDFD-cluster-ui-1.PNG)

To stop the HDFS cluster, simply type:
```bash
$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/stop-dfs.sh
```

### Data load
Once the HDFS cluster is running, it is possible to upload data to it by using the [HDFS File System (FS) shell](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.4/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html). For instance, once a file (`DWFET_CDR_CELLID_201602.csv`) has been uploaded to the master node, it can be stored in HDFS by using the following commands:
```bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir /data
hdfs dfs -put DWFET_CDR_CELLID_201602.csv /data
```
In order to verify that the file has been loaded, the HDFS Web Interface (`http://<master-floating-ip-address>:50070/` > Utilities > Browse the file system) can be used:

![HDFS Web Interface: uploaded file](./images/hadoop-single-file.PNG)

The whole data load process is described in [Data load](./data-load.md).

### Key take-aways
Works such as *[Spark in action](https://www.manning.com/books/spark-in-action)* (Manning, 2017) state that "The installation [of YARN and Hadoop] is straightforward", but depending on the environment it can be not totally true. The main issues addressed when setting up the HDFS cluster in the considered scenario (Openstack cloud with Ubuntu 16.04 instances) are the following ones:
* Private IP addresses must be used when referring to the cluster instances in the configuration files. If floating IP addresses are used, it will be not possible to connect any instance to each other. It is possible to override this behavior and use the floating IP addresses by setting the properties `*-bind-host` in `hdfs-site.xml` to 0.0.0.0 (see the [official guidelines for HDFS multihoming environments](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.8.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsMultihoming.html#Ensuring_HDFS_Daemons_Bind_All_Interfaces)), but this kind of configuration is not possible in Spark.
* Careless password-less ssh setup may lead to exposing the cloud private IP address: it is much more secure to use a key pair just for the cluster. It is created out of the box and the private key uploaded to the master instance. Slave instances do not even need the public key, but only the `authorized_keys` file created as part of the key pair generation process.
* The *NameNode* is a single point of failure in the HDFS cluster. Hosting the *NameNode* and a *DataNode* in the same instance may translate into resource shortage in the *NameNode* and the usual `Name node is in safe mode. Resources are low on NN. Please add or free up more resources then turn off safe mode manually` error message. Although the desployment started initially with a *DataNode* on the master instance, it was finally removed.
